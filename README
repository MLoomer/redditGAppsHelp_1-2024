Still practicing with OOP. OOP feels much cleaner than FP, but with how GAS works it definitely leans towards wanting to use functional programming.

After using Java and C++ so much for school, javascript feels alot more wild. Having iteration and array methods down well in JS though makes me want to lean on it more than other languages.

I need more practice with testing and try/catches. Maybe next project I'll start with TDD with intentional failures and use that for practice.
